```

### Pre-release version

To install the pre-release version that is available in branch `develop`, use:
```r
source('http://callr.org/install#HenrikBengtsson/expectile@develop')

This will install the package from source.  Because of this and because this package also compiles native code, Windows users need to have [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed and OS X users need to have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) installed.
