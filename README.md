# expectile: Modelling of expectiles

## Installing

The **expectile** package is _neither_ on CRAN nor on Bioconductor.  To install it, use:

```r
install.packages("expectile", repos = "https://henrikbengtsson.r-universe.dev")
```

This installs the package from source, which requires proper build tools.
